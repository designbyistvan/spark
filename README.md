Overview

The Spark landing page serves as the online gateway for potential users to learn about the features, and benefits of the Spark application.

Personal Project

This landing page project was developed as a personal project to practice web development skills and create a portfolio piece. Throughout the development process, I gained experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive web design principles.
